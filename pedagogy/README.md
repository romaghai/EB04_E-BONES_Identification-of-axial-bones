<b> Experiment|     <b> Identification of axial bones


<a name="LO"></a>
#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforcement of  theoretical concepts.
Through this experiment, we want our students to understand the structures of axial skeleton and comprehend which axial bones form these structures. So the students shall relate their concept of axial skeleton taught in the class through this practical. 

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository 
###### Assessment Method: Formative assessment 

<u> <b>Description: </b> of how you are going to implement the above Instructional Strategy in your Simulator: </u>
<br>
 The simulator shall visually display the image of complete skeleton first followed by display of structure of skull, division of skull portion into cranial bones and facial bones with appropriate labelling of the bones. Then the simulator shall show the picture of vertebral column, followed by labelling of the bones comprising vertebral column and function shall be displayed in the form of text sentences. Lastly the simulator shall animate thoracic cage followed by labelling of the components of thoracic cage.
