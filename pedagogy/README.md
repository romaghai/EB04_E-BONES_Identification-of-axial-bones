#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforcement of  theoretical concepts.
Students have already gained knowledge regarding axial skeleton in the theoretical classes. So, this experiment is designed in order to verify and recall their concepts learnt in their classes.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb

2.| User will be able to demonstrate which bones form the skull, vertebral column and thoracic cage in the axial skeleton of human body. | [Understand ](http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/vlabs-dev/document.php) | [Demonstrate](http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/vlabs-dev/document.php)
3.| User will be able to outline the function of structures viz skull, vertebral column and thoracic cage of axial skeleton. | [Understand](http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/vlabs-dev/document.php) | [Outline](http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/vlabs-dev/document.php)
4.| User will be able to Identify the position/location of various axial bones with respect to body parts. | [Apply](http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/vlabs-dev/document.php) | [Identify](http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/vlabs-dev/document.php)

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository 
###### Assessment Method: Formative assessment 

<u> <b>Description: </b> Students have learnt theoretical concepts of axial skeleton in their classes. So, this virtual lab will be helpful in recalling as well as verifying the concepts learnt earlier in the class. It will be a protocol based virtual lab simulation. </u>
<br>

<u> <b>Simulator: </b> The simulator shall visually display the image of complete skeleton first followed by display of structure of skull, division of skull portion into cranial bones and facial bones with appropriate labelling of the bones. Then the simulator shall show the picture of vertebral column, followed by labelling of the bones comprising vertebral column and function shall be displayed in the form of text sentences. Lastly the simulator shall animate thoracic cage followed by labelling of the components of thoracic cage.  </u>

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to select the structure that makes up the axial skeleton of the human body. | The student shall observe complete skeleton carefully and then label, in the simulator. | User have to label the structures of axial skeleton.
2.| User will be able to demonstrate which bones form the skull, vertebral column and thoracic cage in the axial skeleton of human body. | The student shall observe the bones of skull (cranial and facial bones), vertebral column and thoracic cage as and when it is shown in the simulator. | 1.The cranium comprised of:  <br> A. Zygomatic bones <br> <b> B. Parietal bones </b> <br> C. Temporal bones <br>  D. Palatine bones <br> 2. The superior part in sternum is <br> <b> A. Manubrium </b> <br> B. Xiphoid process  <br> C. Body <br>  D. None of the above. <br>
3.| User will be able to outline the function of structures viz skull, vertebral column and thoracic cage of axial skeleton. | Student will relate the theoretical concept taught in the class regarding functions of the various structure of the axial skeleton | 3.______ makes up about 2/5th of total height of human being and protects our spinal cord.  <br> A. Thoracic cage  <br>  B. Skull  <br> <b> C. Vertebral column </b> <br>  D. None of the above <br>
4.| User will be able to identify the position/location of various axial bones with respect to body parts. | The student shall apply the previous knowledge gained to identify the location and relate it with the body parts  | 4. Which bones form the posterior part of head <br> A.Frontal bone <br> <b>  B. Occipital bone </b> <br>  C. Temporal bones  <br>  D. Parietal bone <br>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| The student will be able to select the structure of axial skeleton in skeleton displayed on the simulator by pressing “START NOW” | Display the whole skeleton | The purpose is to provide the knowledge of different parts of complete skeleton so that they will be able to differentiate in different parts.
2.| Student has to press next button and will able to differentiate between axial and appendicular skeleton | Display axial and appendicular structures in the same skeleton | The purpose is to enable the student to differentiate between axial and appendicular skeleton
3.| Student has to press TOGGLE button and then will be able to identify the different parts of axial skeleton viz the bones of skull (cranial and facial bones), vertebral column, Hyoid bone and thoracic cage as and when it is shown in the simulator | Display the image of skull (cranium and face bones), vertebral column and thoracic cage one by one with labels | The purpose is to learn more about the different parts of axial skeleton
4.| Student has to press next button and will be able to see cranial bones and has to click on the bone name to know more about it | Display the image of cranial bones  | The purpose is to learn the features of 8 cranial bones
