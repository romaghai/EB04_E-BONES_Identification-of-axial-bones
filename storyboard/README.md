## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Identification of axial bones

### 1. Story Outline:

The story of this virtual lab development is that many concepts are taught in the class. A concept of axial and appendicular skeleton is also taught. So, we thought of making the experiment based on the objective that students should not only be able to remember but also understand as well as apply their learned concept to identify various bones of axial skeleton. The axial skeleton mainly comprises of the following structures like skull, vertebral column and thoracic cage. The skull has 22 bones (8 cranial bones and 14 facial bones). These 22 bones form the framework of our head and face. We would like the user to know that which of these bones form the framework. 
So, the simulator is made in such a manner that the students can click on each bone and learn about its position/location and some features of the bone. The simulator not only teaches but also assess the understanding of the students. In similar manner, bones of vertebral column divided into cervical vertebrae, thoracic vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, sacrum and coccyx are taught. Similarly, the bones of thoracic cage are also demonstrated. There are click buttons available at various places in the simulator which needs to be pressed in order to conceptualize the whole experiment.


### 2. Story:

The story starts with the display of a complete skeleton mentioning the name of experiment i.e Identification of axial bones on the top of the screen and the student has to press the button “Start Now” to start the experiment. The first page displays, that shows a skeleton which can be hovered by the students just to make the experiment interesting. A button “Wrong One” will show if the structures are wrongly selected. Then the button “Click Now” appears. The student has to click the button and a skeleton arises showing its classification into axial skeleton and appendicular skeleton. 
Then on next screen, a switch” Toggle labelling” appears and the student has to press this button in order to see all the axial structures of axial skeleton viz skull bones, ossicles (inner ear), hyoid bone, rib cage and vertebral column. On right hand side of the screen, a 360 degree revolution of skull is displayed along with details of skull.  Then the student has to press the next button to see the 8 cranial bones. The student hovers on each bone to study the details of each bone. Then the student presses the next button and a screen showing 14 facial bones is displayed. The student hovers on each bone to see its exact location and study details of each facial bone. After studying the facial bones, the student has to press the Next button. On pressing the button, quiz assessment questions arises one by one. The student has to click one right option out of four options. If a wrong option is pressed, red colour gets displayed in the background of the option and if right option is pressed, green colour will display and the student can further proceed to the next question. If the student wants to review the concepts, then he can press the back button. Likewise, 3 questions have to be attempted before going to the next axial structure i.e vertebral column. In the next screen, curves of vertebral column shall be shown and student has to click the button to see various vertebrae present in the vertebral column. On pressing next, student will understand the functions of vertebral column. This will be followed by assessment question. In the similar manner, like earlier, red and green colour displays on attempting wrong and right answers respectively. If the student wants to review the concepts, then he can press the back button. Then the student can proceed to the next axial structure i.e thoracic cage by clicking the next button. The student shall click the button and can see the features of sternum and ribs. In the last, assessment on thoracic cage is done in the similar manner as done in earlier questions. Finally, the “End” button as well as a “Restart” button appears after the experiment gets over.
