2.1 Requirements: Simulator containing the Images of bones
2.2 Description:
The human skeleton consists of 206 bones. These bones are grouped into two categories axial skeleton and appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton consists of 80 bones and appendicular skeleton consists of 126 bones.
Axial skeleton: The bones of the axial skeleton contribute to homeostasis by protecting many of the body’s organs such as the brain, spinal cord, heart, and, lungs. They are also important in support and calcium storage and release.
Skull: 
∙ The skull (cranium), with its 22 bones, rests on the superior end of the vertebral column (backbone). 
∙ The bones of the skull are grouped into two categories: cranial bones and facial bones. 
∙ The cranial bones form the cranial cavity, which encloses and protects the brain. 
The eight cranial bones are as follows: 
1. Frontal bone =1 
2. Parietal bones =2 
3. Temporal bones=2 
4. Occipital bone=1 
5. Sphenoid bone =1 
6. Ethmoid bone=1
Fourteen facial bones are as follows: 
1. Nasal bones=2 
2. Maxillae (or maxillas)=2 
3. Zygomatic bones=2 
4. Mandible =1 
5. Lacrimal bones=2 
6. Palatine bones=2 
7. Inferior nasal conchae=2
8. Vomer=1
CRANIAL BONES 
Frontal Bone 
∙ The frontal bone forms the forehead (the anterior part of the cranium), the roofs of the orbits (eye sockets), and most of the anterior part of the cranial floor. 
Parietal Bones 
∙ The two parietal bones form the greater portion of the sides and roof of the cranial cavity . 
Temporal Bones 
∙ The paired temporal bones form the inferior lateral aspects of the cranium and part of the cranial floor.
Occipital Bone 
∙ The occipital bone (back of head) forms the posterior part and most of the base of the cranium. The foramen magnum (large hole) is in the inferior part of the bone. 
Sphenoid Bone 
∙ The sphenoid bone (wedge-shaped) lies at the middle part of the base of the skull . 
∙ This bone is the cranial floor because it articulates with all the other cranial bones, holding them together. 
Ethmoid Bone 
∙ The ethmoid bone (like a sieve) is spongelike in appearance and is located on the midline in the anterior part of the cranial floor medial to the orbits. It is anterior to the sphenoid and posterior to the nasal bones. 
∙ The ethmoid bone forms: 
1. Part of the anterior portion of the cranial floor; 
2. The medial wall of the orbits. 
3. The superior portion of the nasal septum, a partition that divides the nasal cavity into right and left sides. 
4. Most of the superior sidewalls of the nasal cavity. The ethmoid bone is a major superior supporting structure of the nasal cavity. 
FACIAL BONES 
The 14 facial bones include: ⎫ 
2 nasal bones, ⎫ 
2 maxillae (or maxillas), ⎫ 
2 zygomatic bones, ⎫ 
1 mandible, ⎫ 
2 lacrimal bones, ⎫ 
2 palatine bones, ⎫ 
2 inferior nasal conchae, ⎫ 
1 vomer. 
Nasal Bones 
The paired nasal bones meet at the midline and form the bridge of the nose. 
Zygomatic bones 
The 2 zygomatic bones commonly called cheekbones form the prominences of the cheeks and part of the lateral wall and floor of each orbit. 
Lacrimal Bones 
The 2 lacrimal bones resemble a fingernail in size and shape. These bones are the smallest bones of the face, they are posterior and lateral to the nasal bones and form a part of the medial wall of each orbit. 
Palatine Bones 
The 2 (L-shaped) palatine bones form the posterior portion of the hard palate, part of the floor and lateral wall of the nasal cavity, and a small portion of the floors of the orbits. 
Inferior Nasal Conchae 
The 2 inferior nasal conchae form a part of the inferior lateral wall of the nasal cavity and project into the nasal cavity. All three pairs of nasal conchae (superior, middle, and inferior) increase the surface area of the nasal cavity and help swirl and filter air before it passes into the lungs. 
Vomer 
The vomer is a triangular bone on the floor of the nasal cavity that articulates superiorly with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone and inferiorly with both the maxillae and palatine bones along the midline. It forms the inferior portion of the nasal septum. 
Mandible 
The mandible or lower jawbone, is the largest, strongest facial bone. It is the only movable skull bone (other than the auditory ossicles). 
Hyoid Bone 
∙ The single hyoid bone (U-shaped) is a unique component of the axial skeleton because it does not articulate with any other bone. It is suspended from the styloid processes of the temporal bones by ligaments and muscles. 
∙ It is located in the anterior neck between the mandible and larynx. 
∙ The hyoid bone supports the tongue, providing attachment sites for some tongue muscles and for muscles of the neck and pharynx. 
VERTEBRAL COLUMN
∙ The vertebral column, also called the spine, backbone, or spinal column, makes up about two-fifths of your total height and is composed of a series of bones called vertebrae. 
∙ At about 71 cm (28 in.) in an average adult male and about 61 cm (24 in.) in an average adult female. 
∙ The total number of vertebrae during early development is 33. As a child grows, several vertebrae in the sacral and coccygeal regions fuse. 
∙ As a result, the adult vertebral column typically contains 26 vertebrae. 
∙ These are distributed as follows: ⎫ 
7 cervical vertebrae- (cervic- _ neck) are in the neck region. ⎫ 
12 thoracic vertebrae- (thorax _ chest) are posterior to the thoracic cavity. ⎫ 
5 lumbar vertebrae -support the lower back. ⎫ 
1 sacrum - consists of five fused sacral vertebrae. ⎫ 
1 coccyx - usually consists of four fused coccygeal vertebrae. 
Note: The cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae are movable. 
The sacrum and coccyx are not movable.
Thorax 
∙ The term thorax refers to the entire chest. 
∙ The skeletal part of the thorax, the thoracic cage, is a bony enclosure formed by the sternum, ribs and their costal cartilages, and the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae.
Sternum 
∙ The sternum, or breastbone, is a flat, narrow bone located in the center of the anterior thoracic wall that measures about 15 cm (6 in.) in length and consists of three parts. 
∙ The superior part is the manubrium, the middle and largest part is the body; and the inferior, smallest part is the xiphoid process. 
Ribs 
∙ Twelve pairs of ribs, numbered 1–12 from superior to inferior, give structural support to the sides of the thoracic cavity. 
∙ The ribs that have costal cartilages and attach directly to the sternum are called true ribs. 
∙ The remaining five pairs of ribs are termed false ribs because their costal cartilages either attach indirectly to the sternum or do not attach to the sternum at all. 
∙ The eleventh and twelfth pairs of ribs are false ribs designated as floating (vertebral) ribs because the costal cartilage at their anterior ends does not attach to the sternum at all. These ribs attach only posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae.
