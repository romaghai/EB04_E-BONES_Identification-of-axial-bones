### Aim
Identification of axial skeleton
### Theory
2.1 Requirements: Simulator containing the Images of bones
2.2 Description:
The human skeleton is composed of 206 bones. These bones are grouped into two categories axial skeleton and appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton consists of 80 bones and appendicular skeleton consists of 126 bones.
Axial skeleton: The bones of the axial skeleton contribute to homeostasis by protecting many of the body’s organs such as the brain, spinal cord, heart, and, lungs. They help in support and movement.
Skull: 
The skull consists of 22 bones that is present on the upper part of vertebral column. The skull is divided into two parts: bones of cranium and bones of face
• The cranial bones form the cranial cavity, which encloses and protects the brain. 
The eight cranial bones are as follows: 
1. Frontal bone =1 
2. Parietal bones =2 
3. Temporal bones=2 
4. Occipital bone=1 
5. Sphenoid bone =1 
6. Ethmoid bone=1
Fourteen facial bones are as follows: 
1. Nasal bones=2 
2. Maxillae (or maxillas)=2 
3. Zygomatic bones=2 
4. Mandible =1 
5. Lacrimal bones=2 
6. Palatine bones=2 
7. Inferior nasal conchae=2
8. Vomer=1
CRANIAL BONES 
Frontal Bone 
Forehead is formed by the frontal bone. Similarly, the frontal bone forms the roofs of orbital sockets. 
Parietal Bones 
It mainly forms sides and roof of skull.  
Temporal Bones 
• The paired temporal bones form the inferior lateral aspects of the cranium and part of the cranial floor.
Occipital Bone 
This bone forms back part of human head and it has a hole called foramen magnum. Through this hole, spinal cord passes through it.
Sphenoid Bone 
It is present in the central portion of the skull that articulates with all the other 7 cranial bones and hold the bones together.
Ethmoid Bone 
• The ethmoid bone (like a sieve) is sponge like in appearance and is located on the midline in the anterior part of the cranial floor medial to the orbits. It lies in front of the sphenoid bone and, it lies at the back of the nasal bone.
• The ethmoid bone forms: 
1. Part of the anterior portion of the cranial floor; 
2. The medial wall of the orbits. 
3. The superior portion of the nasal septum, a partition that divides the nasal cavity into right and left sides. 
FACIAL BONES 
The 14 facial bones include: 2 nasal bones, 2 maxillae (or maxillas), 2 zygomatic bones, 1 mandible, 
2 lacrimal bones, 2 palatine bones, 2 inferior nasal conchae, 1 vomer. 
Nasal Bones 
The paired nasal bones meet at the midline and form the bridge of the nose. 
Zygomatic bones 
The 2 zygomatic bones commonly called cheekbones form the prominences of the cheeks and part of the lateral wall and floor of each orbit. 
Lacrimal Bones 
The 2 lacrimal bones resemble a fingernail in size and shape. These bones are the smallest bones of the face, they are posterior and lateral to the nasal bones and form a part of the medial wall of each orbit. 
Palatine Bones 
The 2 (L-shaped) palatine bones form the posterior portion of the hard palate, part of the floor and lateral wall of the nasal cavity, and a small portion of the floors of the orbits. 
Inferior Nasal Conchae 
The 2 inferior nasal conchae at both the sides form a part of the inferior lateral wall of the nasal cavity and project into the nasal cavity. They help in enhancing surface area and enable to filtrate air in the nasal cavity.
Vomer
Vomer bone’s shape is like a triangle that makes joint with ethmoid bone at its upper side and forms joint with maxilla and palatine bones below. It forms the inferior portion of the nasal septum. 
Mandible 
The mandible or lower jawbone, is the largest, strongest facial bone. Unlike other facial bones, it is the only bone that can do the movement. 
Hyoid Bone 
• This bone has a shape of U and is present below the skull. The special feature of the bone is that it doesn’t form any joint with any other bone of the skull. The hyoid bone is attached to the temporal bone processes with the help of some muscles as well as ligaments.
• It is located in the anterior neck between the mandible and larynx. 
• The tongue of human body is supported by it. Furthermore, it also gives attachment to some muscles of the tongue, neck as well as pharynx.
 VERTEBRAL COLUMN
• The vertebral column, also called the spine, backbone, or spinal column, makes up about two-fifths of your total height and is composed of a series of bones called vertebrae. 
• The height of Vertebral column is normally found to be higher in males as compared to females 
• In an infant/small child, the vertebral number is found to be 33. However, during development of the child, the regions each of sacrum and coccyx gets fused. Due to this, the total vertebrae reduce to number of 26.
• These are distributed as follows: 7 cervical vertebrae- (cervic- neck) are in the neck region.  
12 thoracic vertebrae- (thorax _ chest) are posterior to the thoracic cavity. 
5 lumbar vertebrae -support the lower back. 
1 sacrum - consists of five fused sacral vertebrae.  
1 coccyx - usually consists of four fused coccygeal vertebrae. 
Note: The cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae are movable. 
The sacrum and coccyx are not movable.
Thorax 
The chest of human body is called as thorax region and skeletal part is known as thoracic cage.
•It is formed by bones viz sternum, ribs and their costal cartilages as well as 12 thoracic vertebrae.
Sternum 
Sternum commonly known as breastbone lies in the middle portion of thoracic wall and is comprised of 3 parts.
The upper portion is known as manubrium followed by the largest portion called body. The inferior portion of sternum is very small in diameter and it is called xiphoid process.
Ribs 
The human body has 12 pairs of ribs that provides support to lateral portions of thoracic cavity. 
• Ribs can be classified into
(a) True ribs (7 pairs): These are attached directly to the breastbone/sternum via their costal cartilage.
(b) false ribs: (5 pairs). The next 3 pairs of ribs are attached indirectly to sternum via costal cartilage.
Floating ribs are the last 2 pairs as their costal cartilage is not attached to the sternum.
